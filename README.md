# Variables in JavaScript

This project is a simple HTML + JavaScript example to practice **variables**.

## Features
- Demonstrates usage of:
  - `let` → for reassignable variables
  - `const` → for constants
  - `var` → older way of declaring variables (not recommended in modern JS)
- Examples include:
  - Cart quantity counter (`+1`, `+2`, `+3`, reset)
  - User details (`Name`, `Age`)
  - Product calculation (`Total Price`)
  - Constant value (`PI`)

## How to Use
1. Use the buttons to interact with the variables.
2. Open **browser console** (F12 → Console tab) to see the results.

## Purpose
This project is intended as a **practice/demo** for beginners learning JavaScript variables.
